    "exploit_prompt": "This vulnerability's root cause is deserializing user input and miss handling of dunder attributes by the deepdiff library. pytorch-lightning uses deepdiff.Delta objects to alter application state based off of actions taken on the frontend. The intended function is to only allow modification of specific state variables. Deepdiff also makes effort to sanitize and protect its input. deepdiff.Delta features a sandboxed pickle deserializer, and they have a specific limited whitelist that prevents code execution there. It also makes an effort to prevent delta's from altering dunder attributes, but this is bypassable via quotes. Because of this, we can construct a serialized delta that passes the deserializer whitelist and contains dunder attributes. Then when the delta is processed, it can be used to access other modules, classes and instances via dunder attributes. Using this arbitrary attribute write, it is possible to manipulate the pytorch-lightning app state to gain total RCE. Any self hosted pytorch-lightning app is vulnerable even in its default configuation, since the delta endpoint is enabled by default.",
